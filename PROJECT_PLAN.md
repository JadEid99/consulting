## ðŸš€ Ready to Start?

This comprehensive plan breaks down your space portfolio into manageable, trackable tasks. Each task has clear acceptance criteria and contributes to the overall vision of an immersive, storytelling portfolio.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve this task breakdown
2. Prioritize which tasks to tackle first
3. Begin with the foundation tasks (EPIC-001, TASK-001, TASK-002)
4. Start gathering assets for the celestial objects and audio

Would you like me to start implementing the foundation tasks, or would you prefer to review and modify this plan first?
